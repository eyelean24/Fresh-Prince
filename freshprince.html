		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
		<p>From western Philadelphia I hail<br>
where in my youth I'd play upon the green<br>
'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd<br>
by ruffians contemptible and mean.<br>
Although the spat was trivial and brief,<br>
it wounded my dear mother deep within;<br>
and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,<br>
she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.<br>
When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,<br>
I came upon a coachman most unique;<br>
and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,<br>
despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.<br>
I survey all the land with princely mien<br>
in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
